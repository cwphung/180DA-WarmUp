1. MQTT makes it possible for users to broadcast a message to many other users on a single network. The challenges with MQTT are knowing which user sent a particular message and storing a message on the broadcast. Messages will not linger in the network; if a user misses when the message was broadcasted, they will never hear it unless it is broadcasted again. If I were using MQTT, a reasonable communications lag time would be around 0.5s. I would prefer using a different method of transmitting data that allows data to sit on the network and be accessed at any time.

a) Our project can use speech recognition to input commands for the game (e.g. left, right, up, down)
b) OUr speech recognition system should be simple as the game only takes simple one button commands. It would be difficult to process a string of commands or set of commands run together at the same time.
c) If we are using a turn based game, we do not need quick recognition because there is no time pressure to execute a move. However, a real-time game where the user reacts to situations would require quick accurate processing.
d) The environment should ideally be quiet and the user should have a high quality microphone in order for the system to perform optimally. However, it may be possible to achieve adequate performance in a noisy environment with a suboptimal microphone if the words we are looking for are simple enough and sound different from each other.
